// First we need to find all files owned by the 'flag00' user

=> /rofs/usr/sbin/john

// By displaying the file found, we find a string.

// It doesn't work as password, apparently it's coded in ROT algorithm
// that we will decode with bruteforce via 'http://theblob.org/rot.cgi'
// and gives us 'nottoohardhere' in ROT-11 step :D

// After trying this password, it works and we execute 'getflag' to obtain our flag
